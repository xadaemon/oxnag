OpenGL x86 NASM Assembly Game Project

Yes... this is a huge undertaking, especially considering that at the moment, I do NOT want to use any libraries. I'm also using NASM instead of MASM, which makes it a bit more challenging for Windows but allows me to write cross-platform assembly - one of the eventual goals.

This project is secondary, something I'm working on in my free time, as most of my current focus is on developing an operating system in Rust.

## Motivation

I really enjoy 64-bit x86 NASM assembly, but I've never worked on anything graphical with it before. OpenGL is another area I've yet to explore. Combining these two challenges is why I'm taking on this project, despite its complexity.

## Building

Using `make` should be enough to build AND run the project.

## Development conventions

### Internal function calling convention

For private (internal) functions, we adhere to the `System V AMD64 ABI` calling convention.
